## More Info
#### What is a Task Definition?
A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:

* Which Docker images to use with the containers in your task.
* How much CPU and memory to use with each container.
* The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task.

Please see the [Amazon ECS Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) for more information on writing and running Task Definitions.

#### About Amazon ECS
Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. Learn more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs).
